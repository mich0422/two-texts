Two Texts
=========

This is the first asignemt.

Prelude
-------

Select two text excerpts, each **written by somebody other than yourself**. They can can be from anywhere, just as long as you can cite your sources. Each text excerpt should be between **500 to 1000 characters** in length (you can use [this site](http://www.lettercount.com/) to check the length). You should select one text for each of the following two prompts:

 * Something that inspires you
 * Something that you find interesting but don't fully understand


Part 1
-------

Save each text into a separate file under the "data" folder -- "one.txt" or "two.txt." Also enter citations for each text below:

### Text 1

<!-- Wolf, Justin. "The Art Story: Minimalism Movement." The Art Story: Minimalism Movement. Accessed February 8, 2015. http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm.-->

### Text 2

<!-- Perl, Jed. "Flower Power." The New York Times. September 25, 2004. Accessed February 8, 2015. http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/books/review/26PERLL.html?_r=0. -->


Next, write instructions in program.txt. They should be step-by-step instructions that can be applied to just about any text to change it into something different. A simple example of three steps would be:

 1. Swap the first sentence and the last sentence.
 2. Replace every common noun with "taco."
 3. Replace all instances of "not" with "definately".

You instructions should be at least three steps long. You are encouraged to think about the meaning of both these texts, and how/why these instructions are changing that meaning.

Try your instructions on each text, and, write the results below in the same text file.
